<p>SmoothWall has the ability to run an Instant Messenger (IM) proxy that
understands multiple IM protocols and can log both conversations and file
transfers. This proxy, like all of the proxies in SmoothWall, will operate
on both the GREEN and PURPLE networks if it is enabled.</p>

<p>Check the <strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox to turn on this service.</p>

<p><strong>MSN</strong>, <strong>ICQ and AIM</strong>, <strong>Yahoo</strong>
and <strong>IRC</strong> can all be proxied and monitored using this service.
In addition, it is also possible to filter English swearwords by checking
on the <strong>Swear-word filtering</strong> checkbox.</p>

<p>Press the <strong>Save</strong> button after enabling or disabling this
service.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This proxy cannot monitor HTTP-based IM
sessions, or sessions made using any kind of end-to-end encryption.</p>
